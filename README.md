# NHL-Draft


Several tools to understand NHL draft and calculate the value of picks.

Current functionality allows you to sort into lists and dictionaries as well as calculate total output of each draft year

Data is correct to start of 2018-2019 season but I am looking to update this asap

Long term plan is to be able to predict the value of a draft selection versus an active player

Eg - project the output of each pick in terms of points, or GAA
